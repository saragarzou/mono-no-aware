# Mono no Aware | 物の哀れ
![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-red)

Mono no Aware is a Haskell spin on Conway’s Game of Life, inspired by the Japanese notion of impermanence—the quiet beauty found in things that fade.

Right now, I’m focused on building out the core mechanics of Conway’s Game of Life. Along the way, expect some experimental touches inspired by _mono no aware_. Maybe even a GUI, if I’m feeling a bit playful.
